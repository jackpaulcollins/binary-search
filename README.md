# binary-search
A ruby class that performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers

the class expects an Array of sorted integers to be searched, and integer "element", to be searched for. 

Example:

arr = [1,2,5,9,23,123,445] <br>
element = 9 <br>
bs = BinarySearch.new(arr,element) <br>
bs.search <br>

#=> found
